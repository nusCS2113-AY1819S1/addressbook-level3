== Introduction
The purpose of this Developer Guide is to provide useful information to software developers who desire to contribute to the project (e.g. optimizing of code, adding test cases, etc.), including an overview of the software architecture, design as well as current implementations and intended functionality of current features. The police database is for police officers(PO) and headquarters personnel(HQP). Both groups will have varying access and authorization levels to this database. POs would be able to read from the database after screening someone while on patrol and choose his course of action base on the status/threat level of subject. HQP would have the added functions of adding and removing people from the database. Refer to quick start to get started.

== Setting up
To set up the project successfully on your computer, follow the steps below.

=== Prerequisites
In order to start the setup, you are required to install the following:

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level3` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level3`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

== Design
The diagram below shows a high level architecture design of the current classes that are used in the project.

image::mainClassDiagramFULLedited.png[]

== Implementation
This section describes some of the more important details of certain features implemented.

// tag::password[]
[[password]]
=== 1a. Password feature

image::Password.PNG[]

*Current Implementation*

This feature provides different access levels of commands to the user, depending on the password entered.

. unlockDevice() - attempts to match a hashcoded user input with an existing password in the passwordStorage.txt file.

The following is an example usage scenario of the password feature.

Step 1: User enters password for HQP.

Step 2: decipherUserCommandText() in MainWindow class identifies command as a password input, through the use of isLocked() method in the Password class.

Step 3: unlockDevice() in Password class is called.

Step 4: The user input, userCommandText, is then hashcoded using userCommandText.hashCode().

Step 5: Using a Buffered reader from the ReaderAndWriter class, a loop through passwordStorage.txt tries to match the hashcoded input with an existing password.

Step 6: The user and password are stored in passwordStorage.txt in this format : "userID (hashcoded)password".

Step 7: When matched, the userID is returned and a welcome message is displayed for the particular user.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How password feature is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a password with no need for username
** Pros: Reduce user's keyboard input
** Cons: Slow buffered reader has to loop through all passwords in the text file
* **Alternative 2:** Using username and password
** Pros: Can use a hashmap for quick look up, with the userID as key and hashcoded password as the value
** Cons: More input from user, and difficult to store in an external text file

=== 1b. Update Password Feature
image::updatePassword.png[]

*Current Implementation*

This feature enables only HQP to update any existing password.

. updatePassword() - user enters existing password to update.
. updatePasswordFinal() - user enters new alphanumeric password to replace existing password.

The following is an example usage scenario of the update password feature.

Step 1: User enters password for HQP.

Step 2: User enters "update password" command.

Step 3: decipherUserCommandText() in MainWindow class identifies the command as "update password" and begins update password sequence.

Step 4: User enters password for HQP.

Step 5: Similar to the password feature, the process of the user input to match the existing HQP password maintains.

Step 6: User enters new 5-character long alphanumeric password.

Step 7: The new entered password runs through passwordValidityChecker() to check if the password is at least 5 characters long and at least alphanumeric. This password is stored as oneTimePassword String.

Step 8: The user enters the same new password. It matches with the oneTimePassword.

Step 9: The Buffered reader then reads reads through passwordStorage.txt, and a Print writer from the ReaderAndWriter class writes existing passwords to a temporary file, while writing the new password in place of the old password that has been requested to be updated.

Step 10: The temporary file is renamed to passwordStorage.txt and deleting the old passwordStorage.txt file.

Step 11: The System returns a message that update password is successful.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How update password feature is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** writing to a temporary file then renaming
** Pros: No conflicts when writing to a new file
** Cons: Space is required for the new file before deleting original file
* **Alternative 2:** Overwriting current passwordStorage.txt file
** Pros: Maintain space usage
** Cons: Many errors when overwriting

// end::password[]

// tag::find[]
[[find]]
=== 2a. "find" command (edited)
image::FindCommand_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

The new "find" command is revised from the existing "find" command in AB3. Instead of finding a person by name, it finds a person using his NRIC.
It also implements the following operations:

. execute() - executes the "find" command itself and displays the result to the user.
. getPersonWithNric() - Searches the Police Records to retrieve the person with the specified NRIC.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "find" command:

Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "find s1234567a" command.

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and runs prepareFind method.

Step 4: prepareFind determines string is a valid nric, then instantiates a new FindCommand.

Step 5: Logic class calls the execute() method on the FindCommand object.

Step 6: The getPersonWithNric() method called in execute() searches the Police Records for the person with "s1234567a" if he exists and person is stored in a list.

Step 7: The person is found and is stored in a matchedPerson list variable. execute() returns a CommandResult using the matchedPerson list as its argument.

Step 8: The CommandResult object displays to the user the searched person and his details, all of which in string form.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How find command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Finding using NRIC
** Pros: Using nric to find people would be better as each person has a unique nric
** Cons: Difficult to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Finding by name
** Pros: Use current implementation
** Cons: There could be multiple people with the same name

=== 2b. "check" command
image::CheckCommand_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Only HQP may use this command. This command displays the timestamps of which a person with the specified NRIC was screened using the "find" command.
The "check" command makes some use of the "find" command. Every time the "find" command successfully finds a person, a line in the format of:
"NRIC timestamp" is printed in a text file called "screeningHistory.txt". The "check" command will read this file and retrieve the timestamps
corresponding to the specified NRIC.

It also implements the following operations:

. execute() - executes the "check" command itself and displays the result to the user.
. getPersonWithNric() - Searches the Police Records to retrieve the person with the specified NRIC.

Below is an example of its usage:

Step 1: The user(a HQP) input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "check s1234567a"

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and runs prepareCheck method.

Step 4: prepareCheck determines string is a valid nric, then instantiates a new CheckCommand.

Step 5: Logic class calls the execute() method on the CheckCommand object.

Step 6: execute() also calls the getPersonWithNric() method. This method will read the screeningHistory.txt line by line, where each line
is in the format of "NRIC timestamp", for example "s1234567a 18/10/2018-2038hrs by hqp". Each line is split into the NRIC and timestamp. If line[0] is the NRIC specified,
the corresponding timestamp is stored in a list.

Step 7: The list from step 6 gets returned by execute() to create a CommandResult object which displays all the timestamps to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How check command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** All timestamps are stored in one file
** Pros: Maintains space usage
** Cons: Slow to retrieve timestamps as have to loop through whole file
* **Alternative 2:** Having a text file for each person, stored in a 'persons' folder
** Pros: Each timestamp would then be stored in the respective text file, Retrieving timestamps would be much more efficient
** Cons: Space complexity would increase especially if the number of persons increased drastically
// end::check[]

// tag::edit[]
[[edit]]

=== 2c. "edit" command

image::EditCommand.png[]
*Current Implementation*

Only a HQP may use this command. This command allows HQP to update their chosen parameters which include the status, offense, postal code
and wanted attributes of a specific NRIC. It is similar to the "find" command in the sense that
it searches for the person in the Police Records list by NRIC. At least one parameter must be updated. Offenses are added not replaced.

It also implements these methods:

1. execute() - executes the "edit" command itself and displays result to user

This is an example scenario of "edit" command

Step 1: The user inputs HQP password and logs in as HQP.

Step 2: The user types "edit n/s1234567a p/510247 s/wanted w/murder o/gun" and executes it.

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and runs the prepareEdit method

Step 4: prepareEdit method in Parser class would parse each non-empty input such as NRIC, Postal Code, Status, Wanted & Offense
        from the input text to instantiate the EditCommand class.

Step 5: Logic class then calls the execute method on EditCommand Object.
        Person with NRIC "s1234567a" is searched for in the Police Records. If he/she exists,
        then the person's attributes get updated accordingly.

Step 6: CommandResult with successful message is returned to Logic class, which then displays
        to user: "Edited person: s1234567a".

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How edit command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Can set attributes for read-only person
** Pros: Editable persons
** Cons: Should ot edit read only person
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain person as read-only
** Pros: Attributes are protected
** Cons: Cannot edit persons easily

// end::edit[]

// tag::delete[]
[[delete]]
=== 2d. "delete" command
image::DeleteCommand_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Only a HQP may use this command. A person's data is allowed to be deleted from the Police Records. It also
implements the following methods:

. execute() - executes the "delete" command itself and displays the success or error message to the user
. resultDeletePrediction() - In the event that the user inputs an NRIC that does not exists, this method will check the Police Records and try to return any person with a similar NRIC to what was given by the user

The following is an example usage scenario of the "delete" command:

Step 1: The user(a HQP) input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "delete s1234567a"

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and runs prepareDelete method.

Step 4: prepareDelete determines string is a valid nric, then instantiates a new DeleteCommand.

Step 5: Logic class calls the execute() method on the DeleteCommand object.

Step 6: In execute(), the Police Records will be iterated through to see if the person with the said NRIC exists.
If not, resultDeletePrediction() will be called to check if any person has an NRIC close to the input.

Step 7: Once the person is deleted, a success message will be displayed to the user using a CommandResult object,
else it would be an error message stating the person with said NRIC does not exist


Alternatives considered:

* Delete by name parameter
** Pros: Much more readable to user to delete a name than an NRIC
** Cons: There can be more than 1 person with the same name, so deleting should use a more unique parameter
//end ::delete[]

// tag::wkFeatures[]
[[wkFeatures]]

=== 3a. "showunread" command
image::inboxCommand.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Once system is unlocked, regardless of which user you are, you can use this command. This command lists the new/unread messages in your inbox based on the password you used to unlock the system.
When messages are sent, they are stored inside a text file called "inboxMessages/'userID'", where 'userID' refers to the ID of the intended recipient.
These text files store messages directed to each individual who can log in and access their personalised inbox.
It also implements the following operations:

. execute() - executes the "showunread" command itself and displays the result to the user.
. loadMessages() - Searches the text file storing messages for the specific police officer identified by the userID and loads it into a data structure, sorting the messages according to how urgent they should be attended to (sorted first by read status, followed by priority and then the time the message was sent).
. concatenateMsg() - Loaded messages are then concatenated in a single string as `fullPrintedMessage` and passed to the main window through CommandResult.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "showunread" command:

Step 1: The user input his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user executes "showunread" command. The "showunread" command calls execute() which also calls getMessagesFor() method.

Step 3: The loadMessages() method searches message storage file for the messages directed to the respective user, if any, and they are stored into a data structure.

Step 4: The messages that are found and are stored in a TreeSet, split by its read status, message priority, timestamp, and the message itself for sorting purposes.

Step 5: The concatenateMsg() method will then append all unread messages in sorted order to a string to be passed to the CommandResult object later.

Step 6: execute() returns a CommandResult using the concatenated string as its argument.

Step 7: The CommandResult object displays to the user the number of unread messages he has, and the list of unread messages sorted according to their urgency.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How showunread command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a TreeSet
** Pros: Auto-sorts by read-status, priority then timestamp
** Cons: Difficult to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Using a List
** Pros: Smaller time complexity
** Cons: Does not auto-sort

=== 3b. "inbox" command

*Current Implementation*
Inbox command has the same implementation as the "showunread" command - except that it shows you all the messages that are in your inbox (both read and unread).
This is to allow you to access the messages that you have previously marked as read.

=== 3c. "read" command
image::ReadCommand_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Once the system is unlocked, you can access unread messages directed to you via the "showunread" command explained above.
Once action has been taken based on what the message sent to you is about, you can mark the message as read using the "read" command. Messages displayd in "showunread" command is first stored inside a static HashMap, with the key as the message index and the message itself as the value of the HashMap. When the user wishes to mark a message as read, he will type "read 'index'", and the respective message displayed at that specific index will be marked as read and updated in the message storage file of the user.
The "read" command can only be used after the "showunread" command has been used at least once successfully.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "read" command:

Step 1: User inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: User executes "showunread" OR "inbox" command. If command is successfully executed, a list of unread messages directed to the user will be displayed.

Step 3: Messages that are read from the user's inbox will also be recorded in a static HashMap called `recordNotifications`, with the message index used as the key.

Step 4: User executes "read 3" command. If 3 is a valid index (i.e. there were at least 3 unread messages that were displayed), the third message displayed will be marked as read.

Step 5: For the messages to be marked as read, the message itself is updated in the HashMap based on the index, and the message storage text file will be overwritten with the messages stored in the HashMap, effectively updating the read status of the message read.

Step 6: The CommandResult object displays to the user a message indicating that the updating of the read status was successful or not.

=== 3d. "clearinbox" command
image::ClearInboxCommand_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Once the system is unlocked, you can clear your own inbox should there be too many messages stored in it using this command.
Once the command has been entered, ReadNotification object will first be generated to attempt reading from the text file storing messages in your inbox.
This is to check that the file exists in the first place. If it reads from the text file successfully, a WriteNotification object will then be generated, instantiating a PrintWriter that overwrites the contents in the
text file storing the messages in your inbox.

It also implements the following methods:

. execute() - executes the "clearinbox" command and displays the result to the user.
. readFromFile() - method from ReadNotification object that attempts to access the contents of the text file.
. clearInbox() - method from WriteNotification object that clears the content in the text file storing the user's messages.
. clearInboxRecords() - clears any records of messages displayed to ensure that all traces of existing messages are also cleared.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "clearinbox" command:

Step 1: User inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: User executes "clearinbox" command. If command is successfully executed, the feedback "Inbox cleared!" will be displayed to the user.
// end::wkFeatures[]

// tag::request[]
[[request]]
=== 3e. "rb" command

image::RequestCommand.PNG[]

*Current Implementation*

The rb command is an abbreviation of request backup.
Both PO & HQP can use this command as anyone can request for help.
When the command is executed, a Msg object is generated.
Inside this Msg object, several fields exist which include:

- Priority of offense
- Patrol resource ID of requester
- Patrol resource respective Google Maps URL Location.
- Current case patrol resource needs help with

Then the Msg object is passed to the writeNotifcation object to be written into the HQP's message file.
The filepath for HQP's message is ./inboxMessages/headquartersInbox

It also implements these following methods:

1. execute() - executes the "RequestHelpCommand" command and displays result to user.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "rb" command:

Step 1: User inputs PO1 password and logs in as PO1.

Step 2: User executes "rb gun".

Step 3: Parser class identifies user command as "rb" and runs prepareRequest method.

Step 4: prepareRequest method identifies offense & current user ID session.

Step 5: RequestHelpCommand class is instantiated with message template consisting  & case
        which in this case is 'gun'.

Step 6: WriteNotification is instantiated to write the message the HQP inbox file.

Step 7: CommandResult with successful message is returned to Logic class, which then displays
                to user: "Request for backup case from po1 has been sent to HQP."

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How rb command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Writes using ReaderAndWriter class
** Pros: Data is maintained across multiple sessions
** Cons: External text files can be tempered
* **Alternative 2:** Using chat client API
** Pros: Safe and reliable real time support
** Cons: Data is not maintained across multiple sessions
// end::request[]

// tag::dispatch[]
[[dispatch]]
=== 3f. "dispatch" command
image::DispatchCommand.PNG[]

*Current Implementation*

Only HQP has access to the "dispatch" command.
Dispatch command sends a message to both the designated requester & backup officers.
The system creates two WriteNotification classes, the first writes to the requester
inbox and the second writes to the backup officer inbox.

The message sent to the requester's inbox includes the ETA for the backup officer
with his/her location both in raw longitude & latitude form and Google Maps URL format.

It is similar for the message sent to the backup's inbox which includes the ETA that
he/she should arrive within & Google Maps URL location of the requester's Location.

It also implements these following methods:

1. execute() - executes "dispatch" command and displays result to user

The following is an example usage scenario of the "dispatch" command:

Step 1: User inputs HQP password and logs in as HQP.

Step 2: User executes "dispatch PO1 gun PO3".

Step 3: Parser class identifies user command as "dispatch" and runs prepareDispatch method.

Step 4: prepareDispatch method identifies PO1 as backup officer, gun as case & PO3 as requester officer.

Step 5: DispatchCommand class is instantiated with 2 different WriteNotification classes for two different files.

Step 6: DispatchCommand object is executed,
        Msg for requester & backup officer are generated to include content explained above.

Step 7: Both Msg objects are passed to WriteNotification class to be written to the respective recipient files.

Step 8: CommandResult with successful message is returned to Logic class, which then displays
        to user: "Dispatch for PO3 backup is successful."

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How dispatch command is implemented

* **Alternatives: ** Similar considerations as rb command.

// end::dispatch[]

* Alternatives considered: Chat Client API
** Pros: Allows real time system with remote access so police officers can view in real time
** Cons: Chat Client does not store messages after closing application (data does not persist), not much API documentation for beginners

// tag::updatestatus[]
[[updatestatus]]
=== 4a. "updatestatus" command
image::UpdateStatus_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

Only HQP can use this command. This command sets the engagement status(the "isEngaged" boolean) of a PO to false.
It also implements the following methods:

. execute() - executes the "updatestatus po[id]" command, sets the isEngaged boolean to false and displays the result to the user

The following is an example usage scenario of the "updatestatus" command:

Step 1: User inputs password and unlocks the system

Step 2: User executes "updatestatus po1" (example PO here is "po1")

Step 3: Parser class identifies command as "updatestatus" and runs prepareUpdateStatus method.

Step 4: prepareUpdateStatus checks is po1 is a valid PO ID through a regex expression and instantiates a new UpdateStatus command.

Step 5: Logic class calls the execute() method in the UpdateStatusCommand object.

Step 6: execute() also calls for the setStatus() method in PatrolResourceStatus class sets the isEngaged boolean of "po1", in this case, to false.

Step 7: A CommandResult object with the successful message is created to be displayed to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How updatestatus command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Internally implemented statuses of POS
** Pros: Faster to look up statuses of POs
** Cons: The statuses reset after you exit the program
* **Alternative 2:** Using a text file to store the statuses of POs
** Pros: The statuses are saved even after exiting the system
** Cons: Time and space complexity increases especially if there are many POs to manage
// end::updatestatus[]

// tag::checkstatus[]
[[checkstatus]]
=== 4b. "checkstatus" command
image::CheckStatus_Sequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

This command lists out all the POs and their current engagement statuses. The POs and their details are stored in an Arraylist as the assumption here is the system will be running continuously for the whole working time, or shift, for example.
It also implements the following methods:

. execute() - executes the "checkstatus" command and stores all POs in a list
. extractEngagementInformation() - iterates through the ArrayList of POs and only store and return their ID and engagement statuses

The following is an example usage scenario of the "checkstatus" command:

Step 1: User inputs password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: User executes "checkstatus".

Step 3: Parser class identifies command as "checkstatus" and returns a new CheckPOStatusCommand object.

Step 4: Logic class calls the execute() method in the CheckPOStatusCommand object.

Step 5: execute() also calls for the extractEngagementInformation() method and stores the PO Ids and the engagement status in a list.

Step 6: A CommandResult object is created and displays the list to the user.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How updatestatus command is implemented

* **Alternative :** Similar considerations as updatestatus

=== 4c. "time" command

*Current Implementation*

This command displays the current time to both HQP & PO.

. execute() - executes the "DateTimeCommand" command

The following is an example usage scenario of the "time" command:

Step 1: User inputs password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: User types "time" and executes it.

Step 3: Parser class identifies command as "time" and returns a DateTimeCommand object.

Step 4: Logic class calls the execute() method in the DateTimeCommand object.

Step 5: execute() calls


//tag::logout[]
[[logout]]

=== 5. "logout" command

*Current Implementation*

This command logs the current user out of the System.

. execute() - executes the "logout" command , all boolean flags related to passwords are set to false and clears the message inboxes.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "logout" command:

Step 1: User executes "logout".

Step 2: decipherUserCommandText() in MainWindow class identifies command as "logout".

Step 3: Boolean flags for isHQP, isPO1, isPO2, isPO3, isPO4, isPO5 in the Password class is set to false. This is done using the lockIsHqp() and lockIsPo() methods in the Password class.

Step 4: isUpdatePasswordConfirm and isUpdatingPassword flags are also set to false through lockUpdatePasswordConfirm() and lockUpdatingPassword() in the Password class is also set to false.

Step 5: resetInboxWhenLogout() in the Inbox class clears all records of displayed messages and resets the number of unread messages to default value of -1.

Step 6: A CommandResult object is created and displays a message that the user is logged out of the System and prompts for a password.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How logout command is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Logout extends command.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Using MainWindow instead of parser to detect that it is the logout command.
* **Alternative 2:** Logout as a method in password class.
** Pros: Can access boolean flags privately in the same class.
** Cons: Not using abstract class of command.

// end::logout[]

// tag::autocorrect[]
[[autocorrect]]

=== 6. Autocorrection feature
image::AutoCorrectSequence.png[]

*Current Implementation*

The autocorrect mechanism is facilitated by use of dynamic programming.
The algorithm called EditDistance checks the number of single character
changes to be made to convert an invalid input into one expected by the
system. Currently, changes involving one single character can be corrected
by the system for commands and changes involving one or two single characters can be corrected by the system for NRICs.
It implements the following operations:

. checkDistance() - It returns the edit distance needed to convert one
string to the other. In this case, it returns the number of single character
changes (either addition of a character, deletion of a character or changing
a character) to convert invalid user input into its most probable correct
implementation.

.The following is an example usage scenario of the autocorrection feature for commands:

Step 1: The user inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user enters an invalid command.

Step 3: The system predicts the most probable intended command the user
would have wanted to input and then prompts the user
to use the prediction given in its valid format.

.The following is an example usage scenario of the autocorrection feature for NRICs:

Step 1: The user inputs his password and unlocks the system.

Step 2: The user tries to edit, delete or check an invalid NRIC.

Step 3: The system predicts the most probable intended NRIC the user
would have wanted to input and then prompts the user
to use the prediction given in the valid format of the command.

The input is checked by the algorithm in the MainWindow before it is sent
to the Parser class. This is to ensure invalid input can be caught by the
algorithm to give its correction before it is deemed as invalid by the Parser
during which time all commands will be laid out to the user.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How autocorrect feature is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using user input directly from MainWindow class
** Pros: Able to autocorrect raw input

=== 7. "shutdown" command

*Current Implementation*

This command shuts down the System.

. execute() - executes the "shutdown" command and returns all boolean flags related to passwords are set to false.

The following is an example usage scenario of the "logout" command:

Step 1: User executes "shutdown".

Step 2: Boolean flags for isHQP, isPO1, isPO2, isPO3, isPO4, isPO5 in the Password class is set to false. This is done using the lockIsHqp() and lockIsPo() methods in the Password class.

Step 3: isUpdatePasswordConfirm and isUpdatingPassword flags are also set to false through lockUpdatePasswordConfirm() and lockUpdatingPassword() in the Password class is also set to false.

Step 4: mainApp.stop() in MainWindow class shuts down the system

// end::shutdown[]

=== Implementation

---

=== 7a. "help" command

*Current Implementation*

The help command returns the list of commands which can be input by the user based on their level of access.
A HQP user is shown all the commands while a PO user is shown only limited commands.

It also implements these methods:

1. execute() - executes the "help" command itself and displays result to user

This is an example scenario of "help" command

Step 1: The user inputs PO password and logs in as PO.

Step 2: The user types "help" and executes it.

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and return the list of commands that can be input by a PO.

=== 7b. "add" command

*Current Implementation*

Only a HQP may use this command. This command allows HQP to update the Police Records with a new subject. The subject can be added with the details- name, NRIC, date of birth, postal code, status, offense
and optional past offences.

It also implements these methods:

1. execute() - executes the "add" command itself and displays result to user

This is an example scenario of "add" command

Step 1: The user inputs HQP password and logs in as HQP.

Step 2: The user types "add John Doe n/s1234567a d/1996 p/510246 s/xc w/none o/theft o/drugs" and executes it.

Step 3: Parser class determines the command word and runs the prepareAdd method

Step 4: prepareAdd method in Parser class would parse the inputs
        from the input text to instantiate the AddCommand class.

Step 5: Logic class then calls the execute method on AddCommand Object.
        Person with NRIC "s1234567a" is added in the addressbook.

Step 6: CommandResult with successful message is returned to Logic class, which then displays
        to user: "New person added: John Doe Nric: s1234567a DateOfBirth: 1996 Postal Code: 510246 Status: xc Wanted For: [none] Past Offences:[drugs][theft]".


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `Parser` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `Parser.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
