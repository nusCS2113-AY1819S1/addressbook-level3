By: `CS2113-AY1819S1-F09-2`      Since: `Aug 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction
The Restaurant Management System (RMS) provides restaurants with a more efficient way to manage their operations. It has a wide variety of features which cater to different roles in a restaurant. In line with Singapore's "Smart Nation" movement, the RMS aims to digitise the restaurant business and make day-to-day operations smoother and simpler. Jump to <<Setting up>> to get started with the development.


== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later

. *IntelliJ* IDE


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.


[[Design-Architecture]]
== Design
// tag::architecture[]

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

//
//`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `Messages` : Used by many classes to write user visible message.
* `Utils` : Contains all the utility methods.
* `Name` : The parent class to the MemberName and EmployeeName classes.
* `Email`  The parent class to the MemberEmail and EmployeeEmail classes.

The rest of the App consists of four key components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Data,*`Data`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

// end::architecture[]

Below contains the description for each of the four key components:

// tag::UI[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

The UI consists of `Main` that implements `Stoppable` and extends `Application`. `Main` is also dependent on `Gui` which is dependant on `MainWindow`.
Furthermore, `Gui` and `MainWindow` are both dependent on `Logic`.

The components use JavaFx UI framework.

The `Main` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Gui` component which relies on the `Logic` component.
// end::UI[]

// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `Logic`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Data` (e.g. adding a new member) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

[NOTE]
Each of the `CommandResult` class is used as a specific constructor to correctly handle the class of the returned list
of result. +
e.g. `OrderCommandResult` constructs a `CommandResult` object that only contains a result message and a list of orders
generated from the ordering commands.
// end::logic[]

// tag::Data[]
[[Design-Data]]
=== Data component
[[fig-DataComponent]]
.Structure of the Data Component
image::DataComponent.png[width="600"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/data[`data`]

.  The Data stores the RMS data
.  It does not depend on any of the other components

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a Tag list in RMS, which all the relevant features can reference. This would allow RMS to only require one Tag object per unique Tag, instead of each feature needing their own Tag object.
// end::Data[]

// tag::storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/seedu/addressbook/storage/StorageFile.java[`StorageFile.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* This component saves the RMS data in an XML format and is also able to load the XML back into data.

// end::storage[]

//
//[[Design-Commons]]
//=== Common classes
//
//Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

// tag::orderimplementation[]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Adding a new order

To avoid writing a long command line when ordering a long list of dishes, a draft order system was implemented.

* When the ordering draft is initialized or cleared, the member `draftOrder` in `Rms.txt` is loaded with a new object
of class `Order`. It is initialize with an empty list of dish and a pseudo-empty customer field that is not `null`.
* By using the draft order command classes, the ordering draft can be edited (e.g. picking the customer from the member
list if they present their membership card, pick the dish from the menu list one by one before confirming the order).
* Once an order is confirmed, the ordering time is recorded and the total price is calculated to create a new `Order`
object that has the same customer and list of dishes fields as the ordering draft to be added to the order list, the
member points of the customer is updated, and the ordering draft is cleared afterward.

// tag::draftpointsimplementation[]

=== Providing the option for members to accumulate and redeem points

To allow members in the RMS to accumulate and redeem points when an order is made, the command `draftpoints` was implemented.

* As long as the customer and list of dish fields are not empty, the command `draftpoints` can be used to add a Points object from the Member class into the draft order. A new Points object will be created to store the points that the user wishes to redeem. Once the order is confirmed, the Points object in the Member class that was added by using the `draftcustomer` command will be updated. The member list will then show the newly updated points of that member while the order list will reflect the points that the member has earned from the order. The final price of the order will be calculated based on the price of each dish multiplied by the quantity and also take into account the number of points redeemed.

// end::draftpointsimplementation[]

=== Saving and Loading the order list

The order list is saved by using an adaptive class that convert the existing data in the objects to a jaxb-friendly
class. This means that the order list stores every information of the owner of an order.

However, the loading the order list cannot be implemented by creating a list of new `Order` objects that contains a new
`Member` object in its customer field based on the data stored in the storage file. This is because the created
customer object are not the same object as the original `Member` object in the member list, so any changes made to the
member list will not get reflected in the order (e.g. not showing the changes of address or phone number if these
fields are to be recorded to the membership database).

To solve this problem, the order list will retrieve the correct object in the loaded member list at the start of the
program using the method `retrieveMember()` in `AdaptedOrder.java`.

=== [Proposed] Program State Control

As there is multiple functionality in the program, it is proposed that a program state control functionality should be
implemented to assist the user navigate through the program. The command keywords can be simplified and the help
message can be specifically wrote in each states to reduce the burdens of remembering very long line of commands.

This can be done by introducing a status variable in the `Logic` module, creating command to change the state variable
and adjusting the returning command in the `Parser` based on that variable.
// end::orderimplementation[]

// tag::statisticsimplementation[]

=== Statistics

==== Displaying Tables

As RMS is a CLI (Command Line Interface) based program, we are not able to display any graphical tables to the users. However, the alternative to this is to print out the tables in an Ascii format. Therefore, the `AsciiTable` class is created. This class helps to format any data into a string that is able to display as an AsciiTable.

In order to display this table correctly, the font being used in the results windows needs to be a monospaced^*^ font.

_*Monospaced fonts refer to fonts with every characters having equal width size._

==== Calculating Menu Statistics

The way the statistics for menu items are calculated is by iterating through the list of orders and incrementing a counter for each unique menu items every time it is sold. These counters are then sorted in ascending order and it will print the menu item with the most sales and the one with the least sales for the best sellers and the unpopular items respectively.


//==== Design Considerations
//
//===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
//
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
//** Pros: Easy to implement.
//** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
//* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
//** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
//** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
//
//===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
//
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
//** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
//** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
//* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
//** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
//** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
//
//=== [Proposed] Data Encryption
//
//_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_
//
//
//=== Logging
//
//We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.
//
//* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
//* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
//* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.
//
//*Logging Levels*
//
//* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
//* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
//* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
//* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
//
//[[Implementation-Configuration]]
//=== Configuration
//
//Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
//
== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

//[NOTE]
//We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.
//
//=== Editing Documentation
//
//See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
//Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.
//
//=== Publishing Documentation
//
//See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.
//
//=== Converting Documentation to PDF format
//
//We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.
//
//Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.
//
//.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
//.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
//.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
//.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.
//

//image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]
//
//[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
//=== Site-wide Documentation Settings
//
//The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.
//
//[TIP]
//Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.
//
//[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
//.List of site-wide attributes
//|===
//|Attribute name |Description |Default value

//
=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

*Method 3: Manual testing*

* Go to https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-F09-2/main/releases[our github release page] and download `Rms.jar` and `Rms.txt`
* Put them into the same folder and run `Rms.jar` and confirm that the program is running with pre-populated data
* `Rms.txt` is populated with existing data, which allows testers to test the program using the data in `Rms.txt`
* Test the program using the user and the developer guide


[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.


=== Types of tests

We have 1 type of test:

//.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
//.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
//.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.commons.UtilsTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.storage.StorageFileTest` +
     `seedu.addressbook.parser.ParserTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.addressbook.logic.LogicTest`


== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

//=== Managing Dependencies
//
//A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
//a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
//b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
//
//[[GetStartedProgramming]]
//[appendix]
//== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started
//
//Suggested path for new programmers:
//
//1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.
//
//2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.
//
//[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
//=== Improving each component
//
//Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).
//
//[discrete]
//==== `Logic` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.
//
//. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
//+
//****
//* Hints
//** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
//** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
//* Solution
//** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
//** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
//** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
//** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
//****
//
//[discrete]
//==== `Model` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.
//
//. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
//+
//****
//* Hints
//** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
//** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
//**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
//* Solution
//** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
//** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
//** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
//** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.
//****
//
//[discrete]
//==== `Ui` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.
//
//. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.
//+
//**Before**

//image::getting-started-ui-tag-before.png[width="300"]
//+
//**After**
//+
//image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]
//+
//****
//* Hints

//==== `Storage` component
//
//*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.
//
//[TIP]
//Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.
//
//. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
//+
//****
//* Hint
//** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
//** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAddressBookStorage.java[`XmlAddressBookStorage`] class.

//[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
//=== Creating a new command: `remark`
//
//By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.
//
//*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.
//
//==== Description
//Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
//Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`
//
//Examples:
//
//* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
//Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
//* `remark 1 r/` +
//Removes the remark for the first person.
//
//==== Step-by-step Instructions
//
//===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
//Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
//. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.
//
//===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
//Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
//. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
//. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
//for `RemarkCommandParser`.
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.
//
//===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
//Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
//. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.
//
//===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
//We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
//. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.
//
//===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
//Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `addressBook.xml` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)
//
//===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `XmlAdaptedPerson` class
//We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/XmlAdaptedPerson.java[`XmlAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Add a new Xml field for `Remark`.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.xml`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.xml`, `validAddressBook.xml` etc., such that the XML tests will not fail due to a missing `<remark>` element.
//
//===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
//Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
//. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].
//
//===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
//Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.
//
//===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
//We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.
//
//**Main:**
//
//. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.
//
//**Tests:**
//
//. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
//
//==== Full Solution
//
//See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/599[PR] for the step-by-step solution.
