== PROJECT: Restaurant Management System

---

== Introduction

The purpose of this portfolio is to detail the contributions that I have made throughout the time that me and my team
have spent on this project.

Our team was formed through our CS2113T module which we were taking together. The project that we have done is an idea
that we have come up with as a team, where we aim to align our project to meet Singapore's goal of cultivating a smart
nation. Not only that, the project has aspects of sustainability that would allow future developers that would like to
adopt our project, to morph existing features or add new features to meet the ever changing needs of users, be it from
the food industry or other industries.

Restaurant Management System is an application that can be run on a desktop,
which helps restaurants run more smoothly and efficiently by turning everyday processes and tasks that needs to be
carried out by restaurants into a paperless and digital format.

The main features of the Restaurant Management System are:

* Menu management
* Order management
* Employee management
* Member management
* Statistics

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_Given below are the contributions that I have made for the project._
|===

* *Major enhancement*: Added employee management features.
** *What it does*: Allows restaurant managers to manage their employees through the system.
The system stores details of the employees
where the managers are able to view, add, edit and delete the details of the employees that are available in the system.
 Additionally, employees of the restaurant can clock in and out their attendance using the system,
  where details of their attendance would be stored in the system.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as restaurant managers using the system
would be able to manage his/her employees more efficiently.
** Highlights: Needed to ensure that the commands implemented would be easy to understand and use for a non-tech savvy audience.
The commands had to properly take care of formatting errors of commands that could be entered by such users and
display examples on how to properly use the command that they are trying to use that can guide them when such
formatting errors are encountered.
