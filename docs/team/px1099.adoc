== PROJECT: Restaurant Manager System

---

== Overview

This portfolio is written to show my contributions to the RMS project.

Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a desktop application written in Java to help users manage a restaurant.

It has five main features:

* Menu Management
* Order Management
* Customer Membership Management
* Employee Management
* Statistics

The interactions of this application with the users are implemented with a Command Line Interface (CLI) which prints out the results based on the command the user type in.

This project is morphed from the
https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3]
created by
https://github.com/se-edu[SE-EDU initiative].

The application is developed by team F09-2 for the module CS2113T in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

The team consists of five people, with each people managing one of the five functionality of the program.

== Summary of contributions

=== Implemented contributions

==== Major contribution

====

Added the functionality to manage orders

* What it does: Allows the user to add, delete, clear and list orders in the restaurant system.
* Justification: This feature is required for a restaurant to keep track of all orders made in the past and present.
It allows conveniences in taking new orders and storing important data for future references.
* Highlights: Not only does this feature requires implementation of an order list management system, it also requires a
new order drafting system to make sure that the flow of adding new order feels natural and to avoid typing very long
command line to add a new order. As a result, many commands were developed for this functionality.
* Credits: The implementation of the order list is based on the code written for the person list in the Address Book
Level 3 made by SE-EDU initiative.

====

==== Minor contributions

====

Display the entered input as part of the returning message

* Makes it possible for users to check what is the recently entered input.
* Helps user figure out any formatting error of the entered input.
* Allows users to quickly copy the previous entered command.
* Assist bug reporting by making both input and output appear at the same time.

Make the input command word cases insensitive

* Prevent error caused by case insensitive commands.

====

=== Proposed Idea For Future Implementations

==== Implement a state control system

====

* What it does: Allows the user to access a specific functionality in the RMS.
* Justification: As there are many functionality in the RMS, having a state control system will make the flow of using
the RMS feels more natural and less confusing.

====

==== Create short command keywords

====

* What it does: Allows quicker input using shorter command keywords.
* Justification: Some of the command keywords are quite long, making it easy to type it wrongly.
