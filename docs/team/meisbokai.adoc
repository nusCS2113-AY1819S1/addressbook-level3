== PROJECT: ClassRepo

== Overview

ClassRepO is a desktop address book application written in Java that targets secondary schools for usage by their students, tutors and administrative staff. This portfolio is meant to document the contributions that I made to the project.

== Roles
In this project, I serve mainly as a Code Quality checker. Aside from the code quality, I also ensure that the language used in the documentation is up to standard.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added a new field *Attendance* which comes with a few commands
** What it does: Enables the ClassRepO to keep track of the students' attendance.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a school already needs to take the students' attendance. A digitalized storage and management of the attendance will make data analysis faster and also reduces the usage of paper (eco-friendly).
** Highlights: This feature uses different forms of software tricks (storage type) to make searching and editing of data more efficient.
** Credits: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30578421[Victor Hernandez] for the base valid date checker method
