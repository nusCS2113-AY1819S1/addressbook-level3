== ClassRepo

== Introduction
This portfolio highlights my contributions to a team software development project. After almost 12 weeks of advancements,
we have created ClassRepo, which is an all-in-one school management system.

== *More About ClassRepo*
ClassRepo is an enhanced AddressBook application, which is targeted at secondary schools to provide them with an easy
and effective learning management system. Our aim is to help the students, teachers and the admin personnel in
secondary schools by bolstering their efficiency. Spending less time on mundane tasks such as attendance taking would
mean an increase in time available for actual learning to take place. With this goal in mind, our app targets 5 key areas,
namely privilege (to ensure data security), exams, assessments & grades, fees and attendance. The users can interact with
our app using a CLI. The application also has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== *How Did I Contribute?*

* Code Contributed - https://nuscs2113-ay1819s1.github.io/dashboard/#=undefined&search=meg1456&sort=displayName&since=2018-09-12&until=2018-11-05&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=true[RepoSense]

* *Major Enhancements*: Added the *Assessments/Grades Feature*
   ** Able to add/list/delete assessments
   ** Able to add/view/delete grades for students individually, for specific assessments
   ** Able to add statistics for any assessment (stored in separate statistics book)

          What It Does: Allows the user (either teachers/ admin) to maintain a list of all assessments in the school. Grades for these assessments can be added to students individually. Finally, the user can also add statistics for each assessment such as average score, max/min score etc. These statistics will be stored in a separate statistics book.

          Justification: This model allows the grades of all students for a particular assessment to be stored together, while making it easier for user to add grades based on assessment. Since the ClassRepo is designed for secondary schools, this feature will ensure that all teachers and admin are up-to-date with all the assessments being conducted and the corresponding statistics.

          Highlights: This enhancement is multifaceted and requires addition of new commands as well as careful modification to existing ones. The implementation requires meticulousness to ensure that the code is well-integrated and runs smoothly without any bugs.

* *Minor Enhancement*: Added functions to allow statistics such as average grade for each assessment to be calculated automatically, so manual work required by the user is reduced.
