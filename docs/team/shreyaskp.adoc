= PROJECT: Police Records and Intelligence System (PRISM)

---

== Overview

This document serves to showcase my contributions towards the CS2113T Software Engineering Project, as well as the role I served.
My team and I have built PRISM using AddressBook - Level 3, provided by the se-edu team as a base.

The Police Records and Intelligence System (PRISM) is a desktop application catered towards the needs of the Police. The System
has two types of users- Police Officers and Headquarters Personnel, each with different levels of access. Both types of users
interact with the System using a CLI (Command-Line Interface). The application is written in Java, and it has a minimalistic
GUI (Graphical User Interface) created with JavaFX.

The main features of the project are - Password, AutoCorrection, Screening History, Notifications and Editing by NRIC. Please refer to the Quick Start guide to get started.

== Summary of contributions

This section summarizes my contributions towards the project and the role I played.

* *Role*: Developer
* *Responsibility*: Code Quality
* *Major enhancement*: *AutoCorrect functionality*
** What it does: Provides suggestions when the user, either Police Officer or Headquarters Personnel, types in an incorrect input.
** Justification: Human beings tend to make mistakes sometimes. This is especially true in the case of the Police force because they have to respond to critical situations by taking the least possible time.
Thus, the AutoCorrect feature is extremely useful in cases where minute errors are made, as the application suggests the right implementation of the otherwise invalid input.
** Highlights: This enhancement covers all commands as well as the unique NRICs of subjects stored in the System database. It will also cover all subjects to be added in the future. The implementation was challenging as it required changes to every command which uses NRIC as input.
** Credits: The Dynamic Programming algorithm that checks the number of single character changes needed to convert one string to another was reused from- https://www.programcreek.com/2013/12/edit-distance-in-java/

* *Minor enhancement*: The user can view the current local time and date using the time command. This is useful especially for providing backup as well as meeting deadlines.
