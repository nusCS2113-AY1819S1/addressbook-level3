== 1 Overview and Introduction

=== 1.1 Portfolio Purpose
This portfolio will be submitted to CS2101 for grading and is used to document my role and contribution to MediBook â€“ an
 application developed under NUS module CS2113T by Team F10-2 of AY1819S1.


=== 1.2 Project Name and Description
https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-F10-2/main[MediBook] seeks to improve healthcare administration for a better
 healthcare experience. This is achieved by digitalising healthcare records.

In this project, I was task with incorporating an appointment feature that allows appointments to be recorded in
 MediBook. This feature is also known as MediCal.

MediBook is built by Team F10-2 of CS2113T of AY1819S1 and consists of four members. Our details can be found in <<README#, README>>.

This project is built on an https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/addressbook-level3[existing Address Book sample application (Level 3)].
MediBook optimises and enhances Address Book Level 3 to suit the needs of healthcare professionals with healthcare administrative matters.


== 2 Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to record and edit appointments*
** What it does:
*** Allows the users to select a person in MediBook to edit the person's appointments
*** Adds and delete several appointments
*** Shows the list of appointments the person has
** Justification:
*** Recording and viewing patient appointments is an important aspect of healthcare administration. With this feature, users can make and view multiple appointments effectively
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement enters its own edit-appointment mode after the user has select the person to edit. Hence, it was
 challenging as there is a need to manage the edit-appointment mode, in addition to making modification to existing
  person in the list, which is not supported in the original AddressBook (Level 3) we started from.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Help message for edit-appointment mode
