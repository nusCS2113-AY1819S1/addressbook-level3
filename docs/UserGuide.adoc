== Introduction

The police database is for police officers(PO) and headquarter personnel(HQP). Both groups will have varying access and authorization levels to this database. POs would be able to read from the database after screening someone while on patrol and choose his course of action base on the status/threat level of subject. HQP would have the added functions of adding and removing people from the database. Refer to quick start to get started
