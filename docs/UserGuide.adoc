=== 4.20 Saving the data

MediBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. As such, there is no
 need to save the data manually. Data is saved in a file called addressbook.txt in the project root folder.

 after typing the exit command or the program is closed. Undo and Redo commands are also only applicable within the browsing session.
