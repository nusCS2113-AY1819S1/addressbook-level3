== 1 Introduction
MediBook v1.4 optimises and streamlines healthcare administration for a better heathcare experience for all.

based on their patients’ appointments.
All of this is secured by the login which also limits the user access level accordingly.

=== 4.20 Saving the data

MediBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. As such, there is no
 need to save the data manually. Data is saved in a file called addressbook.txt in the project root folder.

However, the history of commands made are only available within the browsing session and would no longer be available
 after typing the exit command or the program is closed. Undo and Redo commands are also only applicable within the browsing session.
