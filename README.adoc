* This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Police Database application *written in OOP fashion*. It has a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) that can be seen above.
* It is a Java written program targeted for both *police officers* and *headquarters personnel*.
** For *police officers*, they are able to screen for a person's criminal record based on NRIC (National Registration Identity Card) and requestbackup when needed to headquarters (HQ).
** For *headquarters personnel*, they are able to add, edit, delete criminals from the database. In addition, personnel are also able to dispatch for backup for each personnel.

For police officers on duty, have you ever faced difficulty of screening someone with comfort and speed? +

With this product, you now can just type someone's NRIC and their record will appear to check their criminal status. Old methods of calling HQ to check on someone's status will no longer be used.

HQ personnel also have less administrative workload to deal with. Now, they focus on more important decisions such as sending backup/firefighters in cases of emergency.
